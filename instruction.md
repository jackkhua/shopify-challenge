# Just some user knowledge and instruction

Initially the page should have 7 default images chose by me. :) The main page should be showing all the images in the repository, including the ones you add in the future.

There are functionalities for searching an image by it's title or tags, and this allows searches with multiple tags seperated by comma (so is adding tags for the new image). Searching result will be rendered with a similar page as the index page. Images are shown in little boxes with their title and tags. By clicking the title button, you will be directed to a page with the larger version of that image along with similar images by having similar name in the title or same tags.

## Some design note

I used a python class to mock databases, it can be scallable with ability to add other functionalities like `user access`, `delete image`, `buy images` with this design.
